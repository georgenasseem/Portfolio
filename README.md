# Portfolio 

#### My name is George and I am a 16 year old self-taught developer. I started learning how to code since I was 11 which was when I dicovered I had a growing passion for building my own apps and games. So far I have experimented in Frontend Web development, Game development, Machine Learning, Robotics and 3D modelling. Additionally, I am planning to take couses and enhance my current skillset in those feilds and enter new ones that I am interested in like Ethical Hacking, Cyber Security, App Development (iOS), Database Engineering and Backend Web development by taking courses online and building my own projects in the next 2 years. The reason I started programming is because I liked to create things of my own and make my imagination come to life. I am tring to learn many different tools and programming languages as much as I can to have a wide variety of knowlede although game devolopment is my all-time favorite.
